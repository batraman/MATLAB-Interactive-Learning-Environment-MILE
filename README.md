# MILE: MATLAB Interactive Learning Environment

MILE has been undertaken as a  minor project to help students of our college in learning MATLAB, specifically for writing Scientific Computing Programs in 4th sem. 
It is inspired from SWIRL for R language :)

Uses YAMLparser present at https://code.google.com/p/yamlmatlab/ for now. (files not included right now)
To make it work. Add a folder called YAMLparser when you clone the repo and extract the yamlmatlab parser from the link there
