# MILE: MATLAB Interactive Learning Environment

MILE is a project to help students of our college learn MATLAB while brushing up on their theory
A sample path is included which teaches Bisection Method. We made that path specifically for Scientific Computing that is taught in 4th sem of our college. 

Lesson Builder for MILE: https://github.com/xssChauhan/MILE-Mason

MILE is inspired from SWIRL for R language ( http://swirlstats.com/ )

### Note:

Uses YAMLparser present at https://code.google.com/p/yamlmatlab/ for now. (files not included right now)
To make it work. Add a folder called YAMLparser when you clone the repo and extract the yamlmatlab parser from the link there

Made by Chauhan ( @xssChauhan) and Batra ( @batraman )
P.S. We are no longer developing this project
